    + Fixes regression in ALTER TABLE on multiple columns. (Closes: #932247)

    + Require schema qualification to cast to a temporary type when using
      functional cast syntax (Noah Misch)

      We have long required invocations of temporary functions to explicitly
      specify the temporary schema, that is pg_temp.func_name(args). Require
      this as well for casting to temporary types using functional notation,
      for example pg_temp.type_name(arg). Otherwise it's possible to capture a
      function call using a temporary object, allowing privilege escalation in
      much the same ways that we blocked in CVE-2007-2138. (CVE-2019-10208)

  * New upstream version.
    + Prevent row-level security policies from being bypassed via selectivity
      estimators (Dean Rasheed)

      Some of the planner's selectivity estimators apply user-defined
      operators to values found in pg_statistic (e.g., most-common values).
      A leaky operator therefore can disclose some of the entries in a data
      column, even if the calling user lacks permission to read that column.
      In CVE-2017-7484 we added restrictions to forestall that, but we failed
      to consider the effects of row-level security.  A user who has SQL
      permission to read a column, but who is forbidden to see certain rows
      due to RLS policy, might still learn something about those rows'
      contents via a leaky operator.  This patch further tightens the rules,
      allowing leaky operators to be applied to statistics data only when
      there is no relevant RLS policy.  (CVE-2019-10130)

  * New upstream version.
    + Fix failure to reset libpq's state fully between connection attempts

      An unprivileged user of dblink or postgres_fdw could bypass the checks
      intended to prevent use of server-side credentials, such as a ~/.pgpass
      file owned by the operating-system user running the server.  Servers
      allowing peer authentication on local connections are particularly
      vulnerable.  Other attacks such as SQL injection into a postgres_fdw
      session are also possible. Attacking postgres_fdw in this way requires
      the ability to create a foreign server object with selected connection
      parameters, but any user with access to dblink could exploit the
      problem. In general, an attacker with the ability to select the
      connection parameters for a libpq-using application could cause
      mischief, though other plausible attack scenarios are harder to think
      of. Our thanks to Andrew Krasichkov for reporting this issue.
      (CVE-2018-10915)

    + Fix INSERT ... ON CONFLICT UPDATE through a view that isn't just SELECT
      FROM ...

      Erroneous expansion of an updatable view could lead to crashes or
      attribute ... has the wrong type errors, if the view's SELECT list
      doesn't match one-to-one with the underlying table's columns.
      Furthermore, this bug could be leveraged to allow updates of columns
      that an attacking user lacks UPDATE privilege for, if that user has
      INSERT and UPDATE privileges for some other column(s) of the table. Any
      user could also use it for disclosure of server memory. (CVE-2018-10925)

postgresql-9.5 (9.5.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    If you run an installation in which not all users are mutually
    trusting, or if you maintain an application or extension that is
    intended for use in arbitrary situations, it is strongly recommended
    that you read the documentation changes described in the first changelog
    entry below, and take suitable steps to ensure that your installation or
    code is secure.

    Also, the changes described in the second changelog entry below may
    cause functions used in index expressions or materialized views to fail
    during auto-analyze, or when reloading from a dump.  After upgrading,
    monitor the server logs for such problems, and fix affected functions.

    + Document how to configure installations and applications to guard
      against search-path-dependent trojan-horse attacks from other users

      Using a search_path setting that includes any schemas writable by a
      hostile user enables that user to capture control of queries and then
      run arbitrary SQL code with the permissions of the attacked user.  While
      it is possible to write queries that are proof against such hijacking,
      it is notationally tedious, and it's very easy to overlook holes.
      Therefore, we now recommend configurations in which no untrusted schemas
      appear in one's search path.
      (CVE-2018-1058)

    + Avoid use of insecure search_path settings in pg_dump and other client
      programs

      pg_dump, pg_upgrade, vacuumdb and other PostgreSQL-provided applications
      were themselves vulnerable to the type of hijacking described in the
      previous changelog entry; since these applications are commonly run by
      superusers, they present particularly attractive targets.  To make them
      secure whether or not the installation as a whole has been secured,
      modify them to include only the pg_catalog schema in their search_path
      settings. Autovacuum worker processes now do the same, as well.

      In cases where user-provided functions are indirectly executed by these
      programs -- for example, user-provided functions in index expressions --
      the tighter search_path may result in errors, which will need to be
      corrected by adjusting those user-provided functions to not assume
      anything about what search path they are invoked under.  That has always
      been good practice, but now it will be necessary for correct behavior.

  * New upstream version.

    + Ensure that INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE checks table permissions
      and RLS policies in all cases (Dean Rasheed)

      The update path of INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE requires SELECT
      permission on the columns of the arbiter index, but it failed to check
      for that in the case of an arbiter specified by constraint name. In
      addition, for a table with row level security enabled, it failed to
      check updated rows against the table's SELECT policies (regardless of
      how the arbiter index was specified). (CVE-2017-15099)

    + Fix crash due to rowtype mismatch in json{b}_populate_recordset()
      (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

      These functions used the result rowtype specified in the FROM ... AS
      clause without checking that it matched the actual rowtype of the
      supplied tuple value.  If it didn't, that would usually result in a
      crash, though disclosure of server memory contents seems possible as
      well. (CVE-2017-15098)

    + Fix BRIN index summarization to handle concurrent table extension
      correctly (Álvaro Herrera)

      Previously, a race condition allowed some table rows to be omitted from

      recover from past occurrences of this problem.

  * New upstream version.

    A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.5.X.

    However, if your installation has been affected by the bug described in
    the first changelog entry below, then after updating you may need to take
    action to repair corrupted free space maps.

    + Fix WAL-logging of truncation of relation free space maps and visibility
      maps (Pavan Deolasee, Heikki Linnakangas)

      It was possible for these files to not be correctly restored during
      crash recovery, or to be written incorrectly on a standby server. Bogus
      entries in a free space map could lead to attempts to access pages that
      have been truncated away from the relation itself, typically producing
      errors like could not read block XXX: read only 0 of 8192 bytes.
      Checksum failures in the visibility map are also possible, if
      checksumming is enabled.

      Procedures for determining whether there is a problem and repairing it
      if so are discussed at
      https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Free_Space_Map_Problems.

  * New upstream version.

    + Fix possible mis-evaluation of nested CASE-WHEN expressions
      (Heikki Linnakangas, Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)

      A CASE expression appearing within the test value subexpression of
      another CASE could become confused about whether its own test value was
      null or not.  Also, inlining of a SQL function implementing the equality
      operator used by a CASE expression could result in passing the wrong
      test value to functions called within a CASE expression in the SQL
      function's body.  If the test values were of different data types, a
      crash might result; moreover such situations could be abused to allow
      disclosure of portions of server memory.  (CVE-2016-5423)

    + Fix client programs' handling of special characters in database and role
      names (Noah Misch, Nathan Bossart, Michael Paquier)

      Numerous places in vacuumdb and other client programs could become
      confused by database and role names containing double quotes or
      backslashes.  Tighten up quoting rules to make that safe. Also, ensure
      that when a conninfo string is used as a database name parameter to
      these programs, it is correctly treated as such throughout.

      Fix handling of paired double quotes in psql's \connect and \password
      commands to match the documentation.

      Introduce a new -reuse-previous option in psql's \connect command to
      allow explicit control of whether to re-use connection parameters from a
      previous connection.  (Without this, the choice is based on whether the
      database name looks like a conninfo string, as before.)  This allows
      secure handling of database names containing special characters in
      pg_dumpall scripts.

      pg_dumpall now refuses to deal with database and role names containing
      carriage returns or newlines, as it seems impractical to quote those
      characters safely on Windows.  In future we may reject such names on the
      server side, but that step has not been taken yet.

      These are considered security fixes because crafted object names
      containing special characters could have been used to execute commands
      with superuser privileges the next time a superuser executes pg_dumpall
      or other routine maintenance operations.  (CVE-2016-5424)

postgresql-9.5 (9.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    + Disable abbreviated keys for string sorting in non-C locales
      (Robert Haas)

      PostgreSQL 9.5 introduced logic for speeding up comparisons of string
      data types by using the standard C library function strxfrm() as a
      substitute for strcoll().  It now emerges that most versions of glibc
      (Linux's implementation of the C library) have buggy implementations of
      strxfrm() that, in some locales, can produce string comparison results
      that do not match strcoll().  Until this problem can be better
      characterized, disable the optimization in all non-C locales.  (C locale
      is safe since it uses neither strcoll() nor strxfrm().)

      Unfortunately, this problem affects not only sorting but also entry
      ordering in B-tree indexes, which means that B-tree indexes on text,
      varchar, or char columns may now be corrupt if they sort according to an
      affected locale and were built or modified under PostgreSQL 9.5.0 or
      9.5.1. Users should REINDEX indexes that might be affected.

      It is not possible at this time to give an exhaustive list of
      known-affected locales.  C locale is known safe, and there is no
      evidence of trouble in English-based locales such as en_US, but some
      other popular locales such as de_DE are affected in most glibc versions.

    + Maintain row-security status properly in cached plans (Stephen Frost)

      In a session that performs queries as more than one role, the plan cache
      might incorrectly re-use a plan that was generated for another role ID,
      thus possibly applying the wrong set of policies when row-level security
      (RLS) is in use. (CVE-2016-2193)

    + Add must-be-superuser checks to some new contrib/pageinspect functions
      (Andreas Seltenreich)

      Most functions in the pageinspect extension that inspect bytea values
      disallow calls by non-superusers, but brin_page_type() and
      brin_metapage_info() failed to do so.  Passing contrived bytea values to
      them might crash the server or disclose a few bytes of server memory.
      Add the missing permissions checks to prevent misuse. (CVE-2016-3065)
