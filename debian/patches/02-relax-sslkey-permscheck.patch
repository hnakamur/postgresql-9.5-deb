    Allow SSL server key file to have group read access if owned by root
    
    We used to require the server key file to have permissions 0600 or less
    for best security.  But some systems (such as Debian) have certificate
    and key files managed by the operating system that can be shared with
    other services.  In those cases, the "postgres" user is made a member of
    a special group that has access to those files, and the server key file
    has permissions 0640.  To accommodate that kind of setup, also allow the
    key file to have permissions 0640 but only if owned by root.

    server will prompt for the passphrase and will not start until it has
